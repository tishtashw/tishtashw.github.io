   <li> When introducing a new technology or design, why did Frederick Brooks advise “plan to throw one away?”
       <ul>
           <li>Because you almost certainly won't get it right the first time.</li>
       </ul>
    </li>
   <li> What is a “core” dump? Why the use of the word core?
       <ul>
           <li>When the Computer drops everything and spits out a file reprting the exact contects of its
                memory at the moment of failure. The core refers to the memory chips at the center of your computer.</li>
       </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Rather than writing program statements in binary code, 110101110  1001101111, programmers developed a shorthand 
    language called what?
        <ul>
            <li>A shorthand called "mov"</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Adding layers of abstraction, new programming languages were created: Lisp, Cobol, Algol, Basic. Fortran was the 
    first widely used. What kind of program converted Fortran to binary?
        <ul>
            <li>An uberprogram called a compiler would translate commands into binary.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
