        <li>What do “front ends” and “back ends” mean to software developers?
            <ul>
                <li>The front end is what the users interact with, allowing for the input and output of information 
                    while the back end is what communicates all of this to the computer. The equivalent of C3PO and R2D2.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What did the Lego Hypothesis refer to?
            <ul>
                <li>Reusable code that can be put together like legos to create a new program faster</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Give one reason why the Lego Hypothesis seems to not work so well. 
            <ul>
                <li>Becuase not all code is made the same and with so many different platforms and operating systems 
                    many coders feel they can DIY the code themselves in less time than it would take to find prewritten code
                    and adapt it to their needs
                </li>
            </ul>
