<ol> 
        <li>Structured programming evolved to address what programming practice?
            <ul>
                <li>it was meant to eliminate "procedural pasta" or confused tangles of software created by the "go to" 
                    function commonly used in the sixties and seventies
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Was structured programming a solution to the problem of software development?
            <ul>
                <li>It merely "laid the foundation for more ambigous software to come"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
       <li>Have any techniques shown to improve the software development process
           <ul>
               <li>inforcing schedules or timeline based releases but with the plans built from the "bottom up" or 
                   having the programers produce their own plans rather than management telling them what they needed to complete
                    within the given timeline
                </li>
           </ul>
       </li>
        <li>The “waterfall model” of programming was/is popular. What were some problems with this model?
            <ul>
                <li>It led to some programers sitting, idle, waiting for others to finish, and then trying to fit
                    large pieces to code together all at once leading to a big crash.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What are the four tenets of Agile Software Development?
            <ol>
                <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
                <li>Working Software over comprehensive documentation</li>
                <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
                <li>Responding to change over folloring a plan</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>What did a 2004 study find about the development practices of some two hundred software team leaders?
            <ul>
                <li>that the most dominant practice was none at all</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What is the “Joel Test” and what did he say about Microsoft and the Joel Test.
            <ul>
                <li>a dozen questions made up by Joel Spolsky to judge whether a development organization has its act together
                    with a score of 12 being perfect but anything at a 10 or less being in trouble
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What is Rosenberg’s Law?
            <ul>
                <li>"software is easy to make, except when you want it to do something new....The only software worth making
                    is software that does something new"
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
