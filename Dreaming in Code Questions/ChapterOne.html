<h1>Dreaming in Code Questions</h1>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<ol>
    <li>What roles in the Chandler project did Michael Toy, John Anderson, Ted Burgess, Mitchell Kapor, 
            and Lou Montulli hold.
                    Michael Toy was the manager, John Anderson was the systems architect, Jed Burgess was
                     one of the projects young programmers,Mitchell Kapor was/is the found the funder of the 
                     open source applications foundation, and Lou Montulli was another Chandler programmer. </li> 
    <li>What is “Bugzilla?”
                    A program which holds the list of live bugs that must be fixed in their product
                     a.k.a Chandler</li>
    <li>What is OSAF?
                    Open Source Applications Foundation</li>
    <li>What is the projects name?
                    Chandler</li>
    <li>What will the software do?
                    Chandler is supossed to be a PIM or a “personal information manager”, basically organizing 
                    and sharing calendars, to-do lists, and other information </li>
    <li>What is Toy’s keyword for “black hole” bugs?
                    “Scary”</li>
    <li>What scared Toy so much about Bug 44?
                    The fact that no one can guess how long it will take to fix</li>
    <li>What did Toy refer to as a “snake?”
                    An important problem that no one knew how to attack</li>
    <li>In the software world, what does “slippage” mean?
                    Falling behind schedule</li>
    <li>Fredrick Brooks was a programming manager for what software project?
                    IBM, IBM System/360 specifically</li>
    <li>What is Brooks's Law?
                    “Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.”</li>
    <li>Brooks found what % of project time was spent writing code?
                    1/6th of the time is spent writing code</li>
    <li>Brooks found what % of project time was for testing and fixing bugs?
                    50%, or fully half the time is spent testing and fixing bugs</li>
    <li>Brooks observed that the unit of effort named “man-month” only applied under what conditions?
                    With many workers and no communication among them</li>
    <li>What is the difference between source code and the program you install (.exe) on your computer?
                    The source code allows for modifications while the exe only allows the program to run on the
                     system it’s downloaded on </li>
    <li>What is the one “article of faith” that all “open source” or “free” software advocates share?
                    That software anyone can tinker with is bound to improve over time in ways that “closed”
                     software can’t match</li>
    <li>What is the difference between a “good” programmer and a “great” programmer?
                    A “good” programmer knows what to write but a “great” programmer knows what to reuse and 
                    rewrite</li>
    <li>Eric Raymond’s book “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” made a distinction between two important project
     development ideas, briefly contrast them.
                    The idea is that some software to be sucessful needed built like a cathedral, carefully
                     crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in isolation. Others later
                      found that the method that more closely resembled a bazaar was effective, the idea being
                       that the more people looking at a problem the quicker it was solved. </li>
    <li>Has “open source” software project development refuted Brooks’s “mythical man-month” concerns?
                    I don’t know that it has completely refuted Brook’s concerns but simply proven that there
                     is a way for lots of people to work on a project and still have it be effective.</li>
    <li>What was Andy Hertzfeld’s input when the Chandler project appeared to have stalled?
                    His suggestion was to get something working quick, so that it can be improved upon rather
                     than spinning in place trying to get something perfect working </li>
