            <ul>
                    <li>Chandler is supossed to be a PIM or a “personal information manager”, basically organizing 
                    and sharing calendars, to-do lists, and other information</li>
            </ul>
    </li>

            <ul>
                   <li>The fact that no one can guess how long it will take to fix</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What did Toy refer to as a “snake?”
            <ul>
                    <li>An important problem that no one knew how to attack</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In the software world, what does “slippage” mean?
            <ul>
                    <li>Falling behind schedule</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fredrick Brooks was a programming manager for what software project?
            <ul>
                    <li>IBM, IBM System/360 specifically</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What is Brooks's Law?
            <ul>
                    <li>“Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.”</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Brooks found what % of project time was spent writing code?
            <ul>
                   <li>1/6th of the time is spent writing code</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Brooks found what % of project time was for testing and fixing bugs?
            <ul>
                    <li>50%, or fully half the time is spent testing and fixing bugs</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Brooks observed that the unit of effort named “man-month” only applied under what conditions?
            <ul>
                    <li>With many workers and no communication among them</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What is the difference between source code and the program you install (.exe) on your computer?
            <ul>
                    <li>The source code allows for modifications while the exe only allows the program to run on the
                     system it’s downloaded on</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What is the one “article of faith” that all “open source” or “free” software advocates share?
            <ul>
                    <li>That software anyone can tinker with is bound to improve over time in ways that “closed”
                     software can’t match</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What is the difference between a “good” programmer and a “great” programmer?
            <ul>
                    <li>A “good” programmer knows what to write but a “great” programmer knows what to reuse and 
                    rewrite</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Eric Raymond’s book “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” made a distinction between two important project
     development ideas, briefly contrast them.
            <ul>
                    <li>The idea is that some software to be sucessful needed built like a cathedral, carefully
                     crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in isolation. Others later
                      found that the method that more closely resembled a bazaar was effective, the idea being
                       that the more people looking at a problem the quicker it was solved.</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Has “open source” software project development refuted Brooks’s “mythical man-month” concerns?
            <ul>
                    <li>I don’t know that it has completely refuted Brook’s concerns but simply proven that there
                     is a way for lots of people to work on a project and still have it be effective.</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What was Andy Hertzfeld’s input when the Chandler project appeared to have stalled?
            <ul>
                    <li>His suggestion was to get something working quick, so that it can be improved upon rather
                     than spinning in place trying to get something perfect working</li>
            </ul> 
    </li>
    </ol>
