<h3>Chapter ten</h3>

        Chapter 10 is about the notion of “Software Engineering” and the difficulty of applying this label to
         the development of software. The author suggests that Yertle the Turtle provides an important lesson 
         for programmers. Describe it.

<p>
        The "yertle the turtle" story strikes a strong resemblance to the concept of layers of abstractions, one
         error (or burp) and the whole system comes crashing down.

        Chapter 10 analyzes the idea that software is written rather than built and maybe more concepts closer to those
        of engineering would lead to better working, on time, and on budget code. Unfortunately, the book points out that
        where science has the guiding rules of physics, CS has no such laws making its engineering near impossible.
