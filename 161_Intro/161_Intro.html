<h1>My GitHub Web Intro</h1>
<h3>Natashia White Student Web</h3>
<p>My only previous experience with programming was last term in CS 160 which was a real challenge for me, my
    hope is that now that I have a good understanding of how the course is structured I'll be better prepared to start
    this term off on the right foot. my goal for this course series though is to gain a good understanding of 
    the basics that I can take to a university course next year. </p>
